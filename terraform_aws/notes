#we have the backends
what backend does, is to save the state of the terraform project-file
you can have different backends : 
- local 
- terraform 
- 3rd parties cloud (aws,s3)

you can use the state of an external file using the cli : 
#terraform init -backend-config=region=eu-west-1 -migrate-state#
#terraform init -backend-config="a-file_somewhere" -migrate-state#

in order to save the state in s3 aws for example, you need to add a block of commands inside the providers section : 
    backend "s3" {
        bucket_name = blcokfo_caspws_awps
        region = "es-west-1"
        path = 'anypathiwant'

    }
